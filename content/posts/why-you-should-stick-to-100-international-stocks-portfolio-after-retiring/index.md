When it comes to Personal Finance, there are no universal laws. Each and every resource, book, 
Youtuber and Financial Advisor you bump into will always answer to your financial questions in the 
same way: *It depends*.

And they better do it. Setting financial goals is a very personal matter requiring several years of
commitment to a decision you make at some of your life, assuming that your needs, desires and
priorities won't change in the future. Scary.

Nonetheless, there's a rule that everyone seems to agree on, a mantra recurring in textbooks, 
courses, Youtube videos, pension funds portfolios and Lifecycle products: *Your exposure to Stocks 
should be inversely proportional to your age, or in other words, you should gradually reduce the 
percentage of Stocks in your portfolio and conversely buy Bonds as you approach your retirement date.*

That sounds like a sensible choice right? In your young age, you have little savings, positive 
hopefully-stable cashflow and many years ahead to sustain even the strongest market crash and still
see your portfolio recover and give you positive returns. Then, as you get closer to your retirement,
you start looking a Bonds, with different durations, to keep yourself invested, grow your wealth at 
slower rate but reduce the drawdown risk.

I've been pretty sold on that strategy too until I came across [Episode 284][1] of
[Rationale Reminder Podcast][2] featuring [Scott Cederburg][3], Associate Professor of Finance at the
Eller College of Management.

On the show, Prof. C presented his research work on Lifecycle Investing, sharing his impressive 
findings that a 100% International Stocks portfolio, held throughout one's lifetime, vastly outperforms 
age-based Stock-Bond strategies from every point of view:

- **Retirement wealth accumulation**: *How much money will I have when I retire?*
- **Income replacement in retirement**: *Will I be able to keep the same lifestyle?*
- **Bequests**: *How much money will I leave to my children?*
- **Risk of ruin**: *What's the chance I'll run out of money before I'm dead?*

While a higher accumulated wealth is quite obvious with a 100% Stocks diversified portfolio, in fact
that's what *risk premium* is all about, the other statements are quite mind-blowing. When I think
of Stocks, I think of an asset class with higher expected returns with respect to Bonds but also with
higher downside risk, as in, I'm willing to take the risk of a 50% portfolio drawdown "*knowing*" that
in the long-term my portfolio will recover and still provide me with higher annualized returns than 
Bonds.

But the reasons why I'm willing to take that risk in search of a higher accumulated wealth are crucial:

- I do not expect to withdraw that money for a *very* long time (>20 years)
- I do not rely on that money to live, i.e. I have a job
- In case of a market crash, I'll average my investments dollar cost to squeeze out even higher 
  returns in the following years

Were any of those assumption to fail, I'm not sure I would feel comfortable anymore to risk the 
money of a lifetime in search of a 5% annualized gross excess return.

*Yes, yes, I know that I'm not really risking **all** my life savings investing in stocks. With a 
geographically diversified portfolio, the risk of crashing down to zero is negligible and in 
that case I should probably be more worried of surviving to zombies than thinking about retirement. 
But you get the gist.*

Nonetheless, Prof. C quantitative approach really teased me and being an open-minded, yet doubtful 
Software Engineer, I couldn't resist to jump into Prof. C research paper[^1] and better understand how he
came to those conclusions and, more importantly, whether I should consider them in my lifecycle
investments.

Here's what I found.
