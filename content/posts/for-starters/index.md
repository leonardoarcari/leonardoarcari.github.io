I've been going back and forth on setting up a personal blog for a couple of years now. It's not like
we are in 2010 anymore. The social landscape has changed profoundly: Instagram, Twitter and TikTok
killed people attention ability and turned many into bored, infinite-scrolling, polarized zombies 
incapable of any critical thinking.

I don't like that.

I believe there's no better way of communicating ideas and thoughts than slow, curated, well-written
posts or articles, where thesis and arguments are layed out properly and some effort is required 
from the reader: at least I know you allocated five minutes to read this.

On the other hand, writing such articles puts a much bigger effort on the writer, raising the risk
of never getting some content out for lack of time or delusion. I hope I won't fall prey to any.

See you soon ðŸ¤ž
